This website is an attempt to visualize how much U.S. taxpayers are forking
over to support Donald Trump's extravagant lifestyle.

There are many things we could be using this money for (social security,
social programs, infrastructure improvements, etc), but instead we're paying
for security at a private residence and extravagant vacations. Not cool.
